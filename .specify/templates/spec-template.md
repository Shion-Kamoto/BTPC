## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no Rust code, Tauri commands, RocksDB schemas)
- üë• Written for cryptocurrency users and stakeholders, not developers
- üîí Always consider quantum-resistance and security implications

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "wallet feature" without specifying CLI vs GUI), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas in BTPC**:
   - **Blockchain layer**: Mainnet vs Testnet vs Regtest behavior
   - **Crypto operations**: Which signature scheme (ML-DSA/Dilithium5)
   - **Desktop app state**: Backend-first validation requirements (Article XI)
   - **Wallet operations**: Encrypted persistence requirements
   - **Network behavior**: P2P protocol requirements
   - **Performance targets**: Block validation time, signature verification time
   - **Security/compliance**: Quantum-resistance level, key management
   - **Data retention**: UTXO cleanup, transaction history limits

### BTPC-Specific Considerations
- **Quantum Resistance**: All crypto features MUST use ML-DSA (Dilithium5) or approved post-quantum algorithms
- **Desktop App Features**: MUST reference Article XI constitutional patterns
- **Blockchain Features**: Specify network type (Mainnet/Testnet/Regtest)
- **Wallet Features**: Specify encryption requirements (AES-256-GCM, Argon2id)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a** [cryptocurrency user/miner/node operator],
**I want to** [perform blockchain/wallet operation],
**So that** [achieve quantum-secure goal]

**Example for BTPC:**
- As a **wallet owner**, I want to **send quantum-resistant transactions**, so that **my funds remain secure against quantum computing attacks**
- As a **miner**, I want to **mine blocks with custom messages**, so that **I can timestamp data on the blockchain**
- As a **node operator**, I want to **switch networks dynamically**, so that **I can test features before mainnet deployment**

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [blockchain state, e.g., "blockchain at height 1000"], **When** [action, e.g., "user sends transaction"], **Then** [expected outcome, e.g., "transaction included in next block"]
2. **Given** [wallet state], **When** [crypto operation], **Then** [quantum-resistant result]
3. **Given** [network configuration], **When** [node operation], **Then** [consensus behavior]

**BTPC Examples:**
- **Given** wallet has 100 BTP, **When** user sends 50 BTP with ML-DSA signature, **Then** transaction validates and UTXO updates
- **Given** node syncing blockchain, **When** invalid block received, **Then** block rejected and peer connection evaluated
- **Given** desktop app on Dashboard page, **When** node status changes, **Then** all pages update via Tauri events (Article XI)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [quantum attack scenario]?
- How does system handle [blockchain fork, network partition, orphaned blocks]?
- What if [wallet encrypted with different key derivation parameters]?
- How does [desktop app state synchronize across pages during concurrent operations]?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves blockchain/wallet data)*
**Blockchain Entities:**

**Example Entity Descriptions:**
- **UTXO**: Represents spendable funds. Contains: UTXO ID (txid + vout), amount (credits), owner public key (ML-DSA), block height created. Relationships: belongs to Wallet (via public key match), consumed by Transaction inputs.
- **NetworkConfig**: Represents node network settings. Backend (Rust Arc<RwLock>) is single source of truth (Article XI). Contains: network type enum, RPC port, P2P port. Persisted across restarts, validated before UI updates.
