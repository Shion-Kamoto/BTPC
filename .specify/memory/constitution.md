# BTPC Quantum-Resistant Cryptocurrency Constitution
# BTPC (Bitcoin-Time Protocol Chain) Constitution

**Version 1.0**
**Effective Date: September 24, 2025**
**Status: IMMUTABLE WITHOUT EXPLICIT AMENDMENT**
## Core Principles

### I. Security-First
Every feature MUST prioritize quantum-resistant security; All cryptographic operations MUST use NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms (ML-DSA (Dilithium) signatures, SHA-512 hashing); No hardcoded secrets or credential exposure; All private keys encrypted at rest; Constant-time operations for all security-critical code

### II. Rust-First Development
All core blockchain components MUST be written in Rust; Use cargo workspace for multi-crate organization; Follow Rust memory safety and ownership principles; Zero-cost abstractions preferred; All dependencies audited with cargo-audit

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory for all code: Tests written → Tests fail → Implementation → Tests pass; Maintain >90% test coverage for new code; Integration tests for all cryptographic functions; Comprehensive benchmarks for performance-critical paths; Miri validation for unsafe code

### IV. Blockchain-Specific Testing
Mandatory integration tests for: Consensus mechanism validation, Block validation and propagation, Transaction pool management, Wallet-node communication, Mining and difficulty adjustment, Post-quantum signature verification across all components

### V. Production Readiness
Structured logging with tracing support; Prometheus metrics for all components; Graceful degradation and error recovery; Configurable via TOML files; Docker-ready with health checks; Database migrations for schema changes; Backward-compatible RPC protocols

## Performance Standards

Signature operations: ML-DSA generation <2ms, verification <1.5ms; Block validation: <10ms per 1MB block; Transaction throughput: Target 1000 TPS; Memory usage: <200MB base + ~1GB per million UTXOs; Storage efficiency: ~2GB per million transactions; Network sync: Full node sync in <24 hours

## Development Workflow

All changes via pull requests with mandatory code review; Security-critical changes require security team approval; Automated CI/CD with cargo check, cargo test, cargo clippy, cargo audit; Pre-commit hooks for formatting and basic validation; Release branches for mainnet deployments; Staging environment for testnet validation

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

All PRs must verify constitutional compliance; Security violations are blocking; Performance regressions require justification; Cryptographic changes require expert review; Breaking changes need migration plans; Use CLAUDE.md for AI development guidance

## Article XI: Desktop Application Development (ADDED 2025-10-11)

### Section 11.1 - Single Source of Truth Principle
- **Backend State Authority**: Backend (Rust/Tauri) is the ONLY source of truth for all critical state
- **Frontend as View**: Frontend (JavaScript/HTML) displays backend state, never maintains authoritative state
- **Validation Order**: ALWAYS validate with backend FIRST, then save to localStorage/browser storage
- **State Synchronization**: Use Tauri event system for cross-page state synchronization

### Section 11.2 - State Management Patterns (MANDATORY)
```
CORRECT Flow (Settings Example):
1. User changes setting → Frontend sends to backend
2. Backend validates (e.g., "node must be stopped")
3. If INVALID: Return error, frontend shows error, NO localStorage save
4. If VALID: Backend saves, emits event, frontend updates UI, saves to localStorage

INCORRECT Flow (FORBIDDEN):
1. User changes setting → Frontend saves to localStorage immediately
2. Frontend sends to backend → Backend validation fails
3. localStorage has invalid state, backend has different state
4. Result: Desynchronized state, confusing user experience
```

### Section 11.3 - Event-Driven Architecture
- **Backend Emission**: Backend MUST emit events on all state changes
- **Frontend Listening**: Frontend MUST listen for events and update UI
- **Memory Management**: Event listeners MUST be cleaned up on page unload
- **No Polling**: Use events instead of polling for state updates where possible

### Section 11.4 - Desktop App Error Handling
- **Clear Error Messages**: All errors MUST explain what happened and what the user should do
- **User Guidance**: Errors MUST cite specific requirements (e.g., "node must be stopped")
- **No Silent Failures**: All validation failures MUST be shown to the user
- **Constitutional References**: Critical errors SHOULD reference constitution when applicable

### Section 11.5 - Process Lifecycle Management
- **Detached Processes**: Use ProcessManager for node/miner processes that survive page navigation
- **Cleanup on Close**: MUST stop all managed processes when application closes
- **State Verification**: Verify process actually stopped before updating UI state
- **No Orphaned Processes**: Zero tolerance for orphaned processes after app close

### Section 11.6 - Frontend Development Standards
- **Event Listener Cleanup**: Store unlisten functions, call on page unload
- **Single Toast Notifications**: Prevent duplicate toasts with action flags
- **Backend-First Validation**: Never save to localStorage before backend validation
- **Cross-Page Consistency**: All pages must show identical state at all times

### Section 11.7 - Prohibited Desktop App Patterns
The following patterns are PROHIBITED in desktop app development:
- Saving to localStorage before backend validation
- Maintaining authoritative state in frontend JavaScript
- Polling for state updates when events are available
- Not cleaning up event listeners on page unload
- Silent backend validation failures
- Duplicate notifications for user actions
- Inconsistent state between pages
