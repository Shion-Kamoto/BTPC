# Feature Specification: Application-Level Login/Logout System

**Feature Branch**: `006-add-application-level`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete (2025-10-30)
**Implementation**: Fully tested, all 14 test scenarios passed
**Input**: User description: "Add application-level login/logout system with AES-256 encrypted credential storage. The login page must match the btpc-desktop-app visual style (dark theme, professional icons, consistent layout). On first launch, if no login credentials exist, prompt user to create a master password (separate from wallet passwords). Login credentials should be stored encrypted using AES-256-GCM with Argon2id key derivation. Include a logout button in the UI that clears the session and returns to login screen. The login password protects application access and is distinct from individual wallet passwords used for transaction signing."
**Constitution**: Article XI Compliance Required for Desktop Features

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no Rust code, Tauri commands, RocksDB schemas)
- üë• Written for cryptocurrency users and stakeholders, not developers
- üîí Always consider quantum-resistance and security implications

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "wallet feature" without specifying CLI vs GUI), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas in BTPC**:
   - **Blockchain layer**: Mainnet vs Testnet vs Regtest behavior
   - **Crypto operations**: Which signature scheme (ML-DSA/Dilithium5)
   - **Desktop app state**: Backend-first validation requirements (Article XI)
   - **Wallet operations**: Encrypted persistence requirements
   - **Network behavior**: P2P protocol requirements
   - **Performance targets**: Block validation time, signature verification time
   - **Security/compliance**: Quantum-resistance level, key management
   - **Data retention**: UTXO cleanup, transaction history limits

### BTPC-Specific Considerations
- **Quantum Resistance**: All crypto features MUST use ML-DSA (Dilithium5) or approved post-quantum algorithms
- **Desktop App Features**: MUST reference Article XI constitutional patterns
- **Blockchain Features**: Specify network type (Mainnet/Testnet/Regtest)
- **Wallet Features**: Specify encryption requirements (AES-256-GCM, Argon2id)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a** cryptocurrency wallet user,
**I want to** protect desktop application access with a master password,
**So that** unauthorized users cannot access my wallets and transaction history, even if they have physical access to my device.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: First Launch - Master Password Creation**
1. **Given** the application is launched for the first time with no existing credentials,
   **When** the user opens the desktop app,
   **Then** the system displays a password creation screen with clear instructions.

2. **Given** the password creation screen is displayed,
   **When** the user enters a password meeting minimum requirements and confirms it,
   **Then** the system encrypts and stores the credentials using AES-256-GCM with Argon2id key derivation, and grants access to the main application.

3. **Given** the password creation screen is displayed,
   **When** the user enters passwords that don't match,
   **Then** the system displays an error message and prompts for re-entry.

**Scenario 2: Subsequent Launches - Login**
1. **Given** master credentials exist from a previous session,
   **When** the user opens the desktop app,
   **Then** the system displays a login screen with password input and login button.

2. **Given** the login screen is displayed,
   **When** the user enters the correct master password,
   **Then** the system validates credentials, establishes a session, and displays the main dashboard.

3. **Given** the login screen is displayed,
   **When** the user enters an incorrect password,
   **Then** the system displays an error message and allows retry without locking the account.

**Scenario 3: Logout**
1. **Given** the user is logged into the application,
   **When** the user clicks the logout button,
   **Then** the system clears the session state, returns to the login screen, and prevents access to protected features.

2. **Given** the user has logged out,
   **When** the user attempts to navigate to any application page,
   **Then** the system redirects to the login screen.

**Scenario 4: Visual Consistency**
1. **Given** the login/logout screens are displayed,
   **When** the user observes the interface,
   **Then** the screens match the btpc-desktop-app dark theme with professional SVG icons and consistent layout matching other pages.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the stored credential file is corrupted or deleted manually?
  ‚Üí System treats it as first launch and prompts for new master password creation.

- What happens if the user forgets their master password?
  ‚Üí System displays a warning that password recovery is not possible and the user must manually delete the credential file (losing access to stored session preferences).

- How does the system handle rapid login/logout actions?
  ‚Üí System ensures state synchronization through backend-first validation (Article XI).

- What if the user closes the application window without logging out?
  ‚Üí Session persists until explicit logout or application restart (user choice for convenience vs security).

- How does the master password interact with individual wallet passwords?
  ‚Üí Master password gates application access only. Wallet operations still require individual wallet passwords for transaction signing (two-layer security).

## Constitutional Compliance *(mandatory for desktop features)*

### Article XI Applicability
- [ ] **Not a desktop feature** - Skip Article XI patterns
- [x] **Desktop feature** - Article XI patterns apply (complete checklist below)

### Article XI Compliance Checklist

**Section 11.1 - Single Source of Truth:**
- [x] Identify authoritative state location: **Backend Rust state (SessionState in Arc<RwLock>)** is single source of truth for authentication status
- [x] Frontend displays login/logout UI only, never maintains authoritative authentication state
- [x] Specified: SessionState stored in backend, frontend queries via Tauri command before accessing protected features

**Section 11.2 - Backend-First Validation:**
- [x] All user actions (login, logout, page navigation) validate with backend FIRST
- [x] Failure exits early: Invalid password returns error immediately, NO session establishment
- [x] Specified: Login command validates password with backend before granting access; logout command clears backend session before UI update

**Section 11.3 - Event-Driven Architecture:**
- [x] Backend emits events on authentication state changes:
  - `session:login` - Emitted after successful login
  - `session:logout` - Emitted after logout
  - `session:expired` - Emitted if session becomes invalid (future enhancement)
- [x] Frontend listens for session events and updates UI state
- [x] Specified: Login screen subscribes to `session:login` to navigate to dashboard; all pages subscribe to `session:logout` to redirect to login

**Section 11.6 - Event Listener Cleanup:**
- [x] Event listeners for session events cleaned up on page unload
- [x] No memory leaks from forgotten session event listeners
- [x] Specified: All pages use `beforeunload` handler to call Tauri `unlisten()` for session event subscriptions

**Section 11.7 - Prohibited Patterns:**
- [x] Confirmed: NO localStorage for authentication state (backend Arc<RwLock> is source of truth)
- [x] Confirmed: NO authoritative authentication state in frontend JavaScript
- [x] Confirmed: NO polling for session status (event-driven via `session:logout` events)
- [x] Confirmed: NO duplicate login/logout notifications (single event emission per action)

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- **Existing btpc-desktop-app infrastructure**: Tauri event system, page navigation framework
- **Cryptography libraries**: argon2, aes-gcm crates (already in use for wallet encryption)
- **Professional icon set**: Existing SVG icons for lock/unlock (src/assets/icons-svg/)
- **Dark theme CSS**: Existing btpc-styles.css and design patterns

### Assumptions
- User has write access to application data directory (~/.btpc/) for credential file storage
- Operating system file permissions protect credential file from other users
- User understands difference between master password (application access) and wallet passwords (transaction signing)
- Application restart is acceptable workflow if user forgets master password (no recovery mechanism)
