./btpc-production-launcher.sh setup

# Start everything (node + mining simulation)
./btpc-production-launcher.sh all

# Individual components:
./btpc-production-launcher.sh node      # Blockchain node
./btpc-production-launcher.sh wallet    # Quantum wallet
./btpc-production-launcher.sh mining    # Mining/simulation
./btpc-production-launcher.sh demo      # Quick demo

# Interactive menu
./btpc-production-launcher.sh
```
